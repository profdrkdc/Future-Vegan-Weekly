  "introduction_hook": "Imagine if the leftover okara from your morning soy latte, the thin stillage from pea-protein isolate, and the fungal mycelium trimmings from a bleeding burger could be recombined into compostable chip bags, high-performance sportswear, and precision fish feed—while erasing 150 million tonnes of CO₂e. This is not science fiction; it is the fastest-growing frontier in vegan biotech.",

  "conclusion_summary": "The alt-protein revolution is on track to produce more waste than product. By reframing these side-streams as the primary economic engine, vegan biotech can birth a $50 billion rebound economy that slashes 150 million tonnes of CO₂e, re-industrialises rural communities, and redefines circularity as a profit centre rather than a cost centre. The technology is ready; the economics are converging; the regulations are cracking open. The only missing ingredient is coordinated will."
