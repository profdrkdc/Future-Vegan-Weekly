Act as a research scout. Your goal is to find real, verifiable news items.
The current date is {today}.

Find the 10 most significant news items from the last 90 days, covering these two niches combined:
1. Vegan food created via precision-fermentation, cellular agriculture or gas-fermentation.
2. Vegan materials that replace leather, plastic or construction inputs.

### CRITICAL RULES FOR OUTPUT ###
1.  **URL STRATEGY:** This is your most important task.
    *   **PRIMARY GOAL:** For each news item, you MUST first try to find the real, verifiable, public URL of the article.
    *   **FALLBACK SCENARIO:** IF AND ONLY IF you cannot find a specific article URL, you MUST create a Google search link instead. The search query should contain the company name and key terms from the headline.
    *   **FORMAT for Google Search Link:** `https://www.google.com/search?q=term1+term2+term3` (replace spaces with `+`).
    *   **Under no circumstances should you invent a fake article URL (like example.com).**

2.  **PURE JSON RESPONSE:** Your ENTIRE response MUST be a SINGLE, FLAT JSON ARRAY of 10 items. It must start with `[` and end with `]`. Do not add any text, notes, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON structure.
