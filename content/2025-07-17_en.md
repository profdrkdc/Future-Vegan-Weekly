### üçÑüß¨ Fungus Meets Fermentation: The Vegan Supply Chain Comes of Age

In the last six weeks the two tracks that will redraw the global vegan material economy‚Äîprecision-fermentation proteins and next generation mycelium materials‚Äîmoved from pilot hype to commercial reality. Regulators opened doors, plants started shipping, and Tier-1 partners bet big.

- **[Perfect Day](https://perfectday.com/blog/fda-gras-for-beta-lactoglobulin-pd-2)** (Impact 9) scored a second FDA GRAS letter, this time for its Œ≤-lactoglobulin PD-2, instantly unlocking international filings and broader SKUs for its precision dairy platform.  
- **[Solar Foods](https://solarfoods.com/news/solein-singapore-approval)** (Impact 9) obtained full food-service approval for Solein in Singapore; the first 200 restaurants begin plating carbon-neutral protein in April.  
- **[MycoWorks](https://mycoworks.com/news/sc-facility-opening)** (Impact 9) flipped the switch on the world‚Äôs first tannery-grade mycelium leather plant in South Carolina and started continuous shipments to Herm√®s, giving fungus a seat at the luxury table.  
- **[Formo](https://formo.bio/series-b-financing)** (Impact 8) closed Europe‚Äôs largest Series B food-tech raise ($61 M) and will spin up a 200 kL Berlin fermenter to flood the continent with animal-free casein.  
- **[Mogu](https://mogu.bio/ikea-collaboration)** (Impact 8) signed on as Ikea‚Äôs mycelium acoustic-panel supplier, diverting crop waste into sound-absorbing walls for flat-pack sustainability.  
- **[CULT Food Science](https://cultfoodscience.com/news/noochies-launch)** (Impact 7), [Bel & Superbrewed](https://superbrewedbio.com/bel-partnership), [von Holzhausen](https://vonholzhausen.com/blogs/news/tesla-liquidplant-launch), and **[Mycotech](https://mycotech.id/series-b)** (Impact 7 all) brought cultivated pet treats, postbiotic cheese, plant-based Tesla interiors, and Indonesian mycelium blocks to mass-retail channels.

Watch for copycat approvals across ASEAN, EU Green Deal dollars chasing fermentation capacity, and next-quarter flagship menus proving that proteins grown in stainless steel can outrun those grown on four legs.
