## Breakthrough Week: Two 9-Impact Wins for Vegan Innovation  

This week saw two juggernaut approvals that move “future food” and “next-gen fashion” from lab curiosities to global markets. Both wins carry our highest impact score and signal a seismic shift in how protein is produced and luxury is defined.

- **Food megaton**: [Solar Foods](https://solarfoods.fi/news/eu-approval) secures EU novel-food status for **Solein**—the planet’s first gas-fermentation protein at scale, giving Europe carbon-negative protein powder that needs no land, sunlight, or soy. Score: **9**.  
- **Style breakthrough**: [MycoWorks](https://mycoworks.com/news/hermes-deal) places its **Reishi mycelium leather** inside Hermès’ new Birkin line, pushing mushroom hide past the boutique niche into the icon of luxury itself. Score: **9**.

With Solein hitting restaurant suppliers mid-2026 and Hermès rolling out myc-leather bags as limited editions next autumn, the dominoes are falling fast. Watch for ingredient panels swapping soy for Solein and resale platforms adding MycoWorks authentication—proof that vegan innovation is no longer pitching to the market, it is the market.
